1) 

I would add this line in my .bashrc file :
 date > network_status.log && ping google.com -c 5 >> network_status.log 
And, every time I login, i would see from my network_status.log file, if my network is up.


2)

for i in $(cat machines_list.txt);
do 
ssh user:password@"$i" service fooBar restart
done
